* What are the main results and what conclusions are expected to be drawn from the paper?
* How much confidence in the obtained results are implied by the author(s)?
* Is this confidence justified in your opinion?
     - were the authors scrupulous in discussing their results?
     - were there any weaknesses or limitations in the approach used by the authors?
     - can you think of an alternative interpretation not discussed by the authors?
 

__Submission__: It is expected that the assignment be submitted via Canvas as a word document or PDF (your choice). Paper summaries submitted by email will not be accepted unless agreed upon beforehand with the instructor.
