## Course Description

Biol 417 (3 credits) (Evolutionary Ecology)

Advanced survey of the field of evolutionary ecology: the study of the ecological basis for the evolution of life histories, sex, mating strategies, and social behaviour. 

Prerequisite: BIOL 308 and one of BIOL 202, STAT 230

## Course Objectives

To obtain a familiarity with the field of Evolutionary Ecology. To develop numerical, written, and critical thinking skills.

This course examines the evolutionary basis for a number of ecological phenomena. In the course of this examination, we will be exploring the theoretical and experimental approaches used in current investigations in this field.

## Course Format

Weekly lectures. There are no midterm or final examinations for this course. Grading will be based on ca. weekly written assignments (details follow). Lecture slides will be provided to students the day after the lecture. All lectures will be recorded (subject to any technical glitches) and will be made available to students via Canvas.

## Optional Material

There is no textbook for this course, but if students are interested in additional resources beyond the material covered in the lectures, the following textbooks are recommended:

* Pianka, E. R. (1999). Evolutionary ecology. Benjamin Cummings. ISBN 0321042883. Available digitally via: http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/bio373/ERP-EvolEcol.html

## Course Evaluation

|                        |         |                       |
|------------------------|---------|-----------------------|
|   Paper Summaries (8)  |   32%   |   See schedule below  |
|   Essays (3)           |   48%   |   See schedule below  |
|   Research Proposal    |   20%   |   Week 14             |
|   Total                |   100%  |                       |

Final grades will be based on the evaluations listed above and will be assigned according to the standardized grading system outlined in the UBC Okanagan Calendar.

Note: final grades may be scaled at the discretion of the instructor. Scaling will be consistently applied across all students.

### Paper Summaries (32% – 8 summaries at 4% each)
Beginning the second week of the semester, students will be asked to write a short summary of a research paper that focuses on an area of evolutionary ecology. Papers will be assigned by the instructor and provided to students in advance. The paper summaries should be no longer than one page (single spaced using a 12-point font). References should be included with the report but do not count towards the total length. The following points should be covered (not necessarily in the order given):

* What is/are the issue(s) addressed by the paper?
* What is the underlying research approach taken by the paper (e.g., a manipulative experiment, a correlational study, a theoretical model, a literature review, etc.)?
* What are the main results and what conclusions are expected to be drawn from the paper?
* How much confidence in the obtained results are implied by the author(s)?
* Is this confidence justified in your opinion?
- were the authors scrupulous in discussing their results?
- were there any weaknesses or limitations in the approach used by the authors?
- can you think of an alternative interpretation not discussed by the authors?

__Submission__: It is expected that the assignment be submitted via Canvas as a word document or PDF (your choice). Paper summaries submitted by email will not be accepted unless agreed upon beforehand with the instructor. 

__Grading__: Each summary will be marked on composition (i.e., spelling and grammatical competence), comprehension & logic, clarity, and coverage of points i)-v) listed above, and will be worth a total of 4% of your final grade. Late assignments will have 10% deducted per day that they are overdue and will receive a grade of zero if more than 10 days late without a valid reason.
 

### Essays (48%)
Students will be asked to complete three written essay assignments throughout the course (schedule below). These assignments are designed to provide students with an opportunity to consolidate what they have learned in the lectures and apply this knowledge to topics in evolutionary ecology of their own choosing. For each of these essays, students will receive a topic or question – both Canvas and the course web page will host the essay questions. Students will then be expected to write an essay addressing that topic or question using the material covered in class, as well as additional sources from the scientific literature. Students can expect the material covered in the lectures will provide sufficient information for structuring the essay around the assigned topic but are also expected to expand beyond the material covered in the lectures. The skills gained by completing each essay will help students learn how to think critically about core evolutionary ecology concepts and clearly communicate their ideas in written format.

__Submission__: Essays are to be submitted as word documents or PDFs (your choice) and uploaded to canvas before the due date. The essays should be a minimum of five pages in length (double spaced using a 12-point font). Include references to all necessary literature in a format of your choosing. References must be included, but do not count towards the total length. 

__Grading__: Each essay will be graded based on the pre-provided rubric, and will be worth a total of 16% of your final grade. Late essays will have 10% deducted per day that they are overdue and will receive a grade of zero if more than 10 days late without a valid reason.

### Research Proposal (20%)
Students will prepare a research proposal that will review a topic in evolutionary ecology and outline a plan to address a research question that would advance the field. The proposal should be comprised of the following five sections:

_Introduction_: Provide a description of the system on which the proposed project will focus, citing all relevant literature. Explain what big picture question you are addressing, what work has been done on this topic to date, and why the system you have chosen to work with is a good model for tackling this research question. Length: ca. 2 pages.

_Objectives_: Outline of the key objective(s) the proposed research is aimed at addressing. Provide details on how these objectives will provide information on the big picture question you have set up in the introduction. Length: ca. 1/2 page.

_Methods_: Describe the experimental setup, how the data would be collected and what variables are included. There should be enough information that anyone can use your methods section to carry out the proposed research. Length: ca. 2 pages.

_Significance of the proposed research_: Describe the significance of the study to the field of evolutionary ecology. For instance, what new insights/information will this study yield, what question would it put to rest, how it will benefit the field. Simply put, convince the reader why this work needs to be conducted. Length: ca. 1/2 page.

_References_: Include references to all necessary literature.

 
__Submission__: Research proposals are to be submitted as word documents or PDFs (your choice) and uploaded to canvas before the due date. Research proposals have a maximum length of 5 pages (double spaced using a 12-point font). Figures can be used throughout and are encouraged. References should be included with the proposals but do not count towards the total length.

__Grading__: The research proposal will be graded out of 100 and will be worth a total of 20% of your final grade. Late assignments will have 10% deducted per day that they are overdue and will receive a grade of zero if more than 10 days late without a valid excuse.
